# toggle_tracker
a program inspired by Benjamin Franklin's Virtue Tracker and tray tracking papers in general. 
One that is hopefully, easier to use, more private, easier to analyse, and more sustainable.

- I intend freedom and self-control for your data and experience.
- I also intend to keep working for a very long time and in an AGILE manner. 
- I intend to keep this app focused on being a tool for self-reflection.

# How to Start
Open up the website and toggle buttons on or off to signify that you have worked on it.
Add additional categories - Virtues, Habits - and add components - Kindness, Brushing 2 a day.
Type up a journal entry to review and explain to you - and only to you - why you, e.g., made a lot of progress in industry.

And with an account, you can submit your entry to save within a database.
Eventually, you could visualise and analyse the data yourself or have the app do it for you.
